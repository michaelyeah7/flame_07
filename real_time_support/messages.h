// This file is included by both the real-time and the
// non-real-time code to define the format of the messages passed
// between processes.  These messages generally are sent across
// the real time message ports, but the format might also be used
// to store trace or log files.  All of the message types are
// defined at compile time; this keeps the code clean, although
// it means that this global definition needs to be modified as
// the system is extended.

// The goal here is simplicity; by having just one type of
// message structure the code can be straightforward.  It is up
// to the user to use the correct message types in the correct
// context, since some of these only have meaning for one of the
// nodes in the system.  For this reason all message processing
// functions should safely ignore unhandled types.

// Having said that, there is an exception, since a user is free
// to define additional structures in the same format and use
// them as message types, only care must be taken so no subtype
// codes overlap.

// Note that all values are sent in i386 native byte order!  This
// will be a problem if this code is ever used between systems of
// different endian-ness, e.g., networking a PowerPC with an
// Intel host.

// Define the names of RTAI mailboxes for communication between
// processes on the real time target system.

// Header for message packets.  All messages must include this as the
// first element.  Each message type is of a bounded size, most are of
// fixed size.  The length field is included for generic handling.  A
// checksum is included in case there are problems with buffer overrun
// or the underlying protocol has dropouts.
