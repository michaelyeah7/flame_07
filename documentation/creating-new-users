Under Debian Linux a new user thijs can be created as follows:

  su				# switch to superuser
  [it will ask for the root password]
  adduser thijs	
  [it will ask for a new password for thijs]

In order to have correct permissions for accessing everything on the
machine, the user should also be added to various user groups:

  adduser thijs staff		(essential for svn)

  adduser thijs audio		(most of these are probably not essential)
  adduser thijs dialout
  adduser thijs cdrom
  adduser thijs floppy
  adduser thijs video
  adduser thijs plugdev

After the new user logs in the first time, the "groups" command will
list memberships.

The adduser program will create a home directory in /home and populate
it with a few configuration files.  These are bare defaults; a usable
configuration requires some default window setup, etc.  The easiest
way to do that is to copy over files from some other user and edit
them:

  su				# become superuser
  su thijs			# become the new user
  cd				# switch to the new home directory
  cp ~mwisse/.bash_profile .
  cp ~mwisse/.bashrc .
  cp ~mwisse/.xsession .
  cp ~mwisse/.twmrc .
  cp ~mwisse/.Xdefaults .

By switching to the user first, the files will end up with the correct
permissions, i.e., the new user will own them.
