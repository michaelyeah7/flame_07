emacs is a powerful text editor well suited for program code.  It is
by no means the only option.

On dutw782 is currently installed the emacs variant 'XEmacs'.  It is a
fork of the original emacs, and is very compatible, and some say it
has better window support.

To start XEmacs from the command line as a windowed application:

 xemacs &

To start emacs from the command line in the background as a text
terminal program, or over a ssh link:

 xemacs -nw

In the emacs syntax for command keys, C refers to control and M to
meta.  The definition of meta depends on the specific installation,
but is usually the ALT key.  Meta can also be specified by prefixing
the ESC key.

Examples:

 C-p		control-p		move to previous line
 C-n		control-n		move to next line
 C-v		control-v		move to next page
 M-v		alt-v or ESC v		move to previous page
 C-x C-s	control-x control-s	save file
 C-x C-f	control-x control-f	open a file
 C-x C-c	control-x control-c	exit emacs
 C-x u		control-x u		undo
 C-x C-q	control-x control-q	toggle read-only
 C-g		control-g		interrupt, useful for stopping or quitting actions

 M-x compile	alt-x compile		run 'make' from within emacs
 ESC x compile				same thing using the alternate meta format
 C-h t		control-h t		enter the emacs tutorial
 C-s		control-s		incremental search forward
 C-k		control-k		kill (cut) until end of line
 C-y		control-y		yank (paste) previous cut buffer
 M-y		alt-y or ESC y		after C-y, cycle through the history of previous cut lines

 
Emacs allows keeping an arbitrary number of files open in different buffers.
 C-x b		switch to another buffer
 C-x C-b	show the list of all open files

The display can be split into multiple panels known as "windows".
 C-x 2		split the display into two windows
 C-x o		switch the cursor to another window
 C-x 0		close the current window (does not affect the buffer or file)

Multiple windows can also be opened, known as "frames".

================================================================
XEmacs can be configured by writing emacs lisp scripts in
the ~/.xemacs directory.  Here is a simple ~/.xemacs/init.el file:

;; This is configuration file for XEmacs, which of course is an Emacs 
;; Lisp program. 
                                     
;; enable syntax highlighting 
(turn-on-font-lock) 
 
;; make the window title simply Xemacs, not the file name 
(setq frame-title-format "XEmacs") 
(setq frame-icon-title-format "XEmacs")
