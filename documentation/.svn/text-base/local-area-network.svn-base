The Flame robot is connected to the host computer
dutw782.wbmt.tudelft.nl using a local network simply consisting of a
single crossover CAT5 cable between the robot and the PCI ethernet
card.

The port on both the robot and host can in theory support 100Mbps, but
this was found to be unreliable, possibly due to the short cable
segment, so the port was configured on the robot side to only support
10Mbps; see /etc/init.d/disable_ethernet_autoneg.sh

The motherboard on dutw782 ethernet has Linux name eth0, and is used
for the Internet connection.  The eth0 IP assigned by TU Delft DHCP is
130.161.19.14, dutw782.wbmt.tudelft.nl.

The PCI ethernet card is named eth1, for the robot LAN, with MAC
08:00:09:ec:86:ca.

Under Debian Linux the ethernet port configuration is specified in
/etc/network/interfaces.  Both eth0 and eth1 are configured to
auto-configure at boot time.

To manually bring the link up or down:
  ifup eth1        
  ifdown eth1

The ipmasq package is used for NAT (Network Address Translation) so
any host on the LAN (including the robot) can access the Internet.

A suitable setup for a LAN host or the robot:
	IP 192.168.1.2
	mask 255.255.255.0
	router 192.168.1.1	(this is the LAN address of dutw782)
	DNS 130.161.180.1 130.161.180.65

Restarting the NAT:
  /etc/init.d/ipmasq restart

Un-installing the NAT software package:
  apt-get remove ipmasq

Re-installing the NAT software package:
  apt-get install ipmasq
