The Flame robot is running a normal installation of Debian Linux with
a minimal set of packages installed.  Many commands which work on
dutw782 also work on the robot.

A few special commands for the robot only:

 Flame_off		safely power down the robot
 rodisk			remount the FLASH drive read-only
 run_control_demo	a script to start the two programs comprising the sample controller

These are all stored in /usr/local/bin

For a discussion of backing up the system, see robot-system-backup.

================================================================

The rodisk script is really trivial, here's the complete contents
of /usr/local/bin/rodisk:

#!/bin/sh
# Remount the root file system read-only as a hedge against
# disk errors when turning the power off.

sync
mount /dev/hda1 / -r -o remount


================================================================
Checking the FLASH drive.

Automatic disk checking was disabled since the machine boots so
frequently and the clock is often wrong. However, it is a good
idea to do it by hand occasionally, perhaps right after a backup.

  rodisk
  fsck /dev/hda1
