This file has design notes for the battery monitor and relay control
circuit on the Flame robot at TU Delft.  This circuit is part of the
front panel circuit board, which also contains user interface switches
and indicator LEDs. Much of the circuit is documented in text directly
on the schematic; that will not be replicated here.

A primary design goal was to provide voltage monitors to protect each
battery from deep discharge by automatically shutting off the computer
supply or motor supply or both.  Another goal was to save motor
battery power by allowing the controller to shut off power when not in
operation.  Since the board needed to include switches for manual
power on and off and emergency stop, it was also a convenient place to
put the rest of the user interface switches.

Notes.

Batteries.  There are separate batteries for the PC/104 stack and the
motor drivers.  The computer battery is approximately 11V, and the
motor battery approximately 30V.

MAX8212CS.  One limitation of the MAX8212CS voltage monitor chip is
that the supply cannot be as high as 30V; for this reason, the motor
battery monitor is powered from the computer battery voltage.  This
does lead to a slight indicator ambiguity; if the computer battery is
disconnected, the "motor voltage good" LED will always go dark, even
if the motor battery is sufficiently charged.

Solid State Relays.  The batteries supply substantial currents, so a
relay was required to switch the supplies.  I chose to use solid state
relays due to the extremely low control currents; many mechanical
relays I examined required nearly an ampere of current to stay on, and
the solid state relays require only 1.6mA.

Computer Relay Control. The first goal was to provide a manual start
and stop for the computer power, but also allow the computer to shut
itself off.  The start behavior is provided by means of pushbutton
switch S1 and latching resistor R3.  The switch supplies relay control
current, and the latching resistor turns it into a latch via positive
feedback from the switched supply to the control current; after S1 is
released the relay will keep itself turned on.  The power-down
behavior is implemented through a "wire-OR" circuit on the
11V_RELAY_CTL line; if either switch S2 is closed or transistor Q1 is
activated, the small latching current will be shunted to ground and
the relay will turn off.  The automatic turn off is provided by IC1,
which will de-activate the open-drain output on the battery low
condition; it is series with the relay, so it will always interrupt
the relay control current.

Motor Relay Control.  The motor relay control is similar, with a
latching circuit, an off control, and an automatic shutdown.  However,
it also includes an E-stop switch to manually disable motor power and
a power-on control to turn on motor power automatically during
experiments.  A PCB position is provided for a manual power start, but
it is unlikely to be necessary.  The circuit is powered by the 11V
switched supply so the motor relay will always turn off if the
computer battery shuts off.

Design Errors.

There were two significantly incorrect assumptions in the original
design.  The first mistake was assuming that the digital I/O outputs
from the Athena CPU board were 0 to 5V signals; instead they are 0 to
3.3V signals.  The second was assuming that the relay input is an
optoisolator diode; although it has polarity marked, it does seem to
conduct in reverse.

The relay input behavior was a problem because the "battery good"
indicators source current onto the negative "RTN" inputs; normally
this current is conducted to ground through the MAX8212CS when voltage
is good.  When voltage is not good, the MAX8212CS is open, and the
relay was receiving a reverse control current and turning on
unexpectedly.  However, this problem was easily fixed by putting a
diode in series with each relay control to block reverse currents.

The digital drive was more of a problem due to the use of a common
emitter switching circuit using Q3 to turn the motor relay on. With 5V
digital inputs, the transistor would have brought 30V_RELAY_CTL up to
about 4.4V, i.e., 5V base voltage minus the base-emitter drop.  Going
around the circuit, this would have been 3.8V after the diode drop,
then the relay drop, then the MAX8212CS output transistor drop. The
sum of voltage drops would have left just enough margin to turn on the
relay.

However, with a 3.3V digital drive signal, Q3 can never develop enough
voltage to overcome the transistor-diode-relay-transistor voltage drop
with the relay engaged.  The solution was to remove R24 and install a
voltage divider consisting of a 1K pullup to +5V and a 1K resistor in
series with MOTOR_POWER_ON in front of R21 on the base of Q3.  This
lifts the quiescent voltage on the base of Q3 to 2.5V, and the active
voltage to 4.15V.  In practice, this seems to be enough to activate
the relay, even though the actual relay voltage is below the rated
control input range.  Unfortunately, it does also mean that
30V_RELAY_CTL would be driven to about 1.9V even when inactive; for
safety, the code has been modified to always drive MOTOR_POWER_OFF to
sink that current through Q4 to ground whenever the motor supply is
supposed to be off.

For safety, R30 was also rerouted from GND to the 11V_SWITCHED supply;
this guarantees that the motor relay is always forced off during
startup.  This is a concern because the MOTOR_POWER_ON line is reset
to a digital input at power-up, and so Q3 is biased into conduction
until the software can initialize the port.  A further detail is that
the +5V supply takes some time to stabilize, since it is the output of
a switching supply powered from 11V_SWITCHED.  With this
configuration, Q4 is guaranteed to be driving the relay off before Q3
begins to conduct as the +5V supply comes active.

Another minor error was underestimating the A/D converter bias
currents; the resistors chosen for the voltage dividers which reduce
the battery voltages for measurement were too large, and the A/D
converters produced bogus results; these resistor values were
decreased to increase the measurement signal currents.
