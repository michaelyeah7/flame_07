This directory contains a body of code related to the "Flame"
biped robot under development at TU Delft.  The robot
incorporates a PC/104 stack running RTAI Linux.  The code
mostly is meant for this target, but some host code is also included.

The hardware and realtime support is written as a set of static
libraries to be linked into an application

Support libraries:

  hardware_drivers/	user-space drivers, i.e., direct port I/O
  real_time_support/	wrapper code for using RTAI, messaging support
  utility/		other miscellaneous useful routines, e.g. errprintf
  scheme/               support code written in the Guile dialect of Scheme
  xsens/                support for a xsens IMU (inertial measurement unit)
  mrdplot/              an interactive plotting program for MATLAB

Applications:

  test_programs/	miscellanous binaries for debugging libraries
  Diamond_utilities/	programs that use the Diamond Systems library to configure and test hardware
  data_utilities/       progams to manipulate dataset data files

  control_demo/		a simple controller to demonstrate a working system

================================================================

The code is now stored in a subversion repository, available at this URL:

   svn+ssh://dutw782.wbmt.tudelft.nl/home/subversion/Flame

or locally:

   file:///home/subversion/Flame

The repository has the following branches:

  trunk/	main line of code, with up to date hardware parameters, etc.

  branches/joe	the local modifications made by Joe in the Spring of 2006, not up to date with the hardware
